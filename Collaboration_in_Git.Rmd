# Collaboration in Git
***

This chapter presents how to work with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

In general, Git is a version control system to track changes in text file (e.g., do-files, R scripts, csv, etc) and to share those changes with other people. Git is capable of letting you know whether a binary files (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF, DTA, etc) has changed, but it won't tell how it changed. To get the most out of Git, programers combin it with GitHub, which is a website that to share code with anybody (including people outsite the World Bank), solicit improvements via pull requests, and track issues. 

## Initial Set up

### Installation {-}
Make you follow the step below:

1.	Open a GitHub account using your World Bank email account. [Here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) or [here](https://github.com/).

2.	Download [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) and install it. You don’t need admin permissions to install it, but do NOT download it in the "downloads" folder.  

  * Open GitKraken and sign in using your Github account rather than creating a "gitkraken account." **Make sure you're using Google Chrome instead of IE.**

3.	[Install GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Optional). This step is optional because the two steps above suffice for working with Git. However, if you got into Git and want to do really advance stuff, you need to work with GIT directly. 

4.	Make sure R and RStudio are installed and updated in your computer. Even though we have not decided whether or not to work with R from now on, Rstudio is great IDE that allows us to do a lot of things including GIT management

## Getting to know GitKraken

Git is a program originally executed at the command line. However, learning the syntax and commands may be time-consuming and using it in this way is maingly useful for high-level developers. Thus, we recommend the use of a Git GUI such as GitKraken. However, if you're interested on learning Git at the command line, we recommend the book *Pro Git* by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, which is available [online for free](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). 

The best place to learn everything about GitKraken is the [GitKraken Support](https://support.gitkraken.com/) webpage. However, bellow you will finde the most basic things that you need to know about it and, when considered necessary, you will find either reference links for more detailed inforamtion or embeded videos. For instance, the video bellow shows the basics of GitKraken.

```{r video1, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/ub9GfRziCtU")
```

### GItKraken Interface

```{r GKinterface, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "GitKraken Interface"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gitKraken_ide.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:GKinterface) presents the GItKraken interface, which has four main components. 

1. The **Toolbar** shows the most common actions in repositories. In our case, we will focus on *pull*, *push*, and *branch*. 

2. The **Left reference panel** shows properties of your repository. In this panel you can see waht branches are steored in your local computer and which in the cloud (i.e., remote repository). You may use it also to know whether you're ahead or behind any specific branch. 

3. The **Commit panel** at your right is where files and changes from your working directory are being watched (i.e., tracked). In this panel you may can see whether a particular file has been modified (orange), deleted (red), created (green) or renamed (blue) with respect to the previous commit. Also, you can see the state of your files with in your current commit. That is, you may know whether each file is staged or unstaged. 

```{r GKcolors, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "color guide for file symbols"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/GK_colorsGuide.PNG")
```

4. The **commit graph** is the core of your repo and a representation of the [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). As explained in the GitKraken documentation, *"[e]ach row of the graph represents one commit, and the top is always for the latest changes. An interactive //WIP (Work-In-Progress) node will show if the working directory has changed since the last commit. Branches and tag labels on the left side of the graph are pointers to specific commits, and each vertical column represents a branch currently available on the repository. Columns can intersect through merge commits as shown in the graph legend. As also shown, multiple branches can be at the same place of a single commit and can be both local and remote."*

```{r GKnodes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Nodes meaning"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/GK_nodes.PNG")
```

## Basic Git Jargon

### Create a repository

In Git, a repository refers to a folder with all the files and sub-folders of a project. In other words, it refers to the folder of a project. It is possible to create a git repository in an existing project folder, but it is recommended to intialize a Git repository before you start working on your project. 

1. Open GitKraken and click on the folder icon at the upper-left side of the screen and then click `Iniut`. Alternatively, you coul go to `file -> Init repo`, or use the shortcut `Ctrl + I`.

2. Given that we are going to be working with GitHub, click on the icon `GitHub.com`.
  
  2.1. Select your account in case you have more than one GitHub account. 
  
  2.2. Provide a name for your repository. The name cannot have spaces. 
  
  2.3. If you want, add a description of the project. 
  
  2.4. Select Public or Private repository. Keep in mind that if you have a free GitHub account:
    * You can have unlimited public repositories with unlimited collaborators. 
    * You can have unlimited *private* repositories with no more than **three collaborators**. This is very inconvinient for large teams like PovcalNet. 
  
  2.5. Check the box `Clone after init`
  
  2.6. Select the folder in your computer where you want to clone the repository. Make you do NOT create a folder for the repositoy because Git will created for you using the name provided in step 2.2. You only need provide the root folder. 
  
  2.7. Do not do anything on the field `Full Path`. It is just for your information. 
  
  2.8. Do not select anything on `.gitignore` yet. We wil cover that below.
  
  2.9. If you are creating a package or a document that must be cited if used, select `MIT license`
  
  2.10. leave unchecked the box `initialize with LFS`

  Your screen should look something like this:
  ```{r initrepo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Initialize repo"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/init_repo.PNG")
  ```

3. Once you have create your repository, make sure to open it and initialize it.


### Clonning a repository

If you want to contribute in an existing repository, you can do it as an existing collaborator or as an external user. We will focus 



### General process to commit and push

These are the general steps you must take into account to commit in your repository. **Bold** means the corresponding pane in the *Commit panel*:

1. **Unstaged Files** — Watched files in your working directory that have changed since the last commit. modified (orange), deleted (red), created (green) or renamed (blue)
2. **Staged Files** — Files manually added to the index that are ready to commit. You may have several files modified in the **unstaged** pane, but you only stage those that you want to commit. 
3. In addition, you may want to commit only individual lines, hunks, or all of the changes in your commit. This can be done by click in the the filename in the **unstage** pane and click on the lines or hunks to be added. When some lines or hunks are left *unstaged*, the file itself would be in both the **unstaged** pane and the **staged** pane. 
4. Record your commit message for the staged changes to the repository. In **Summary** you include a brief but meaningful message supporting your commit. This text will appear in the graph and is mandatory. In **Description** you may add extended message to provide more details behind the changes.
5. Click **Commit changes**
6. You may repeat this process as many times you want. When you're ready, you may push your work to the remote repository into your own branch.
