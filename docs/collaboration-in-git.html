<p>This chapter presents how to work with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">GitKraken</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>In general, Git is a version control system to track changes in text file (e.g., do-files, R scripts, csv, etc) and to share those changes with other people. Git is capable of letting you know whether a binary files (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF, DTA, etc.) has changed, but it wonâ€™t tell how it changed. To get the most out of Git, programmers combine it with GitHub, which is a website that to share code with anybody (including people outside the World Bank), solicit improvements via pull requests, and track issues.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Initial Set up<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#initial-set-up"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Make sure you follow the steps below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open a GitHub account using your World Bank email account. <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">Here</a> or <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Download <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download/">SmartGit</a> and install it (see <a href="collaboration-in-git.html#install-smartgit">below</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Install GIT</a> (Optional). This step is optional because the two steps above suffice for working with Git. However, if you get into Git and want to do really advance stuff, you need to work with GIT directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure R and RStudio are installed and updated in your computer. Even though we have not decided whether or not to work with R from now on, Rstudio is great IDE that allows us to do a lot of things including GIT management .</p></li>

</h2>
<p>Git is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">Distributed Version Control System</a>. This means that Git is a system to fully clones the project and in its history into any clientâ€™s repository or local computer. Every time you save the state of your project (i.e., commit), Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots of the whole project. This ability of taking snapshots of the projects is what makes Git to any other version control system. Other systems, like Microsoft Word or any other MS software, changes are tracked at the file level rather than at the project level. People is able to know how files have changes individually, but they donâ€™t know how those files change with respect to the changes applied to other files of the same project.</p>

</h3>
<p>Branching and merging are the core of collaborating with multiple people. Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the â€œdefaultâ€ branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion. â€œGit branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bugÃ¢Â€â€no matter how big or how smallÃ¢Â€Â”you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your futureâ€™s history before merging it into the main branch."<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Atlassian, â€œGit Branch | Atlassian Git Tutorialâ€ Atlassian, accessed June 3, 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3>Installation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#install-smartgit"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Download <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/download/">SmartGit</a> and install it. Download the files into the the folder that youâ€™ll use for installation and NOT into the â€œdownloadsâ€ folder. If SmartGit automatically downloads the zip file into the â€œdownloadsâ€ folder, then extract it into the folder youâ€™ll install it in. You donâ€™t need admin permissions to install it, but download the <em>Portable Bundle</em>. The installation files can be found here: â€˜SmartGit &gt; bin &gt; smartgit.exeâ€™.</p>
<p>Note: (1) During the installation process pick the â€œnon-commercial useâ€ option; (2) Integration with GitHub might be easier if you use the same username and email as that of your GitHub account.</p>
</div>
<div id="integration-with-github" class="section level3 unnumbered" number="">
<h3>Integration with GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#integration-with-github"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Once SmartGit is installed, do the following to integrate your GitHub account:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Go to â€˜Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Hosting Providersâ€™. Click the â€œAddâ€¦â€ button on the top-right of the window.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a few ways to integrate. The easiest is to pick the â€˜Use OAuth token for repository authentication (instead of password)â€™ option. This should generate a token in your web browser. Use this token to complete the integration.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the GitHub account is added, your GitHub account should be listed in â€˜Hosting Providersâ€™ window in SmartGit. You can also check your GitHub account to make sure that SmartGit has been authorized. To see this, in your GitHub account, go to â€˜settings &gt; applicationsâ€™. You should see SmartGit listed under â€˜Authorized Appsâ€™.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the instructions on integration <a href="http://www.syntevo.com/doc/display/SG/GitHub+integration">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>- Commit</strong></p>
This command saves local changes to your local repository. Each commit is accompanied by a commit message. It is good practice to commit your changes often in order to save them in the repository.

First, let us take a look at the SmartGit interface.

<p>We can also stage and commit binary files (e.g.Â MS office files). However, Git will not track changes. This video also shows how to push your files to the host.</p>

<p><strong>- Pull</strong></p>
<p>This command fetches commits from a remote repository and includes them into your local branch. You can pull from the remote repository clicking on the pull icon and selecting Pull in the window that appears on your screen:</p>

<p><strong>- Create a new branch</strong></p>
<p>Branching is a crucial step in collaborating with others in Git. You start a new branch to store your work independently from the master tree. Remember that in Smartgit you need to double click on your local branch to check-out: this simply means that you are making the selected branch your local one.
You can see the steps to create and check-out your new branch below.
We start from the simplest example. We cloned a repository with only the master branch (see in the Branches window):</p>

<p>When working with Git it is important to be aware of the different steps of the Git workflow. The four different environments you can work with are 1) your <em>workspace</em>, 2) the <em>staging environment</em> (also know as the Git Index), 3) your <em>local repository</em> and 4) your <em>remote repository</em> (typically on the Github).</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>- Commit best practices</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important habits when working with projects in Git is to commit <em>often</em> and <em>early</em>. The reason for this is at a commit should only contain changes related to a single problem. If you discover a new problem, you should do a separate commit. This is much easier to achieve if you start out by committing changes early on in the project. It is of course also important that the commit solves the problem that it claims to solve, so doing an extra code check before you commit is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>- Stage vs Commit</strong></p>
<p>Staging is a necessary pre-step before committing a change to your local repository. It does not however affect your repository in any significant way, and <em>does not change</em> your Git history. A staged file can be easily unstaged to remove it from your Git index.</p>
<p>A commit on the other hand saves changes to your local repository. This <em>does affect</em> your Git history. A commit can be reverted, but it is not as easy as unstaging a file. The general rule is to commit often, but make sure your code works before you commit.</p>
<p><strong>- Writing commit messages</strong></p>
<p>A good commit message should be concise, but also add the details necessary for people to understand what the commit does. This is particularly important when working on a shared project (but it could also be important for your future self!). Anybody should be able to look at your commit message and get an instant sense of <em>why</em> the commit was implemented.</p>
<p>It is important to start your commit message with a short one line summary of maximum 50 characters. This should preferably be written in the imperative. An example on how to structure a good commit message is given below (taken from this <a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules">blog post</a>).<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Chris Beams (2014). â€œHow to Write a Git Commit Messageâ€, accessed June 16, 2020,
&lt;a href="https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>An example of a good commit messageâ€™s structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less</p>
<p>More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely); various tools like <code>log</code>, <code>shortlog</code>
and <code>rebase</code> can get confused if you run the two together.</p>
<p>Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Hereâ€™s the place to explain them.</p>
<p>Further paragraphs come after blank lines.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bullet points are okay, too</p></li>
<li><p>Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
vary here</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:</p>
<p>Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>- Amend a commit</strong></p>
<p>You can amend a previous commit if needed, for example if you made a significant typo and want to correct it or if you want to add a more detailed explanation to your commit message. You can also use amend to add more changes to a previous commit, but depending on how large those changes are you could also consider just adding a new commit. <strong>Note: It is important to not amend commits that you have already pushed to a shared repository.</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Stash</strong></p>
<p>If have some uncommitted changes that you donâ€™t want to commit, but still want to save them for later use you can use the Stash option. The two commands for this in SmartGit are â€œSave Stashâ€ and â€œApply Stashâ€, shown with the icons below. You can think of this as putting your changes in a box (with Save Stash) and then opening this box later if you need to (with Apply Stash).</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>- Unstage</strong></p>
<p>This easiest â€œundoâ€ operation in Git is to unstage a file you have previously staged (prepared for commit). This is useful if you realize that the file needs some more work before solving the problem or adding the feature you are working on.</p>
<p>Remember that it is always a good idea to check that your code is working before committing to your local branch. If you find an error at this step of the workflow just unstage the file. In SmartGit this can be done by clicking the below icon. Note however that unstaging will not help you if the commit has already been made.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/SG_unstage.png" width="53"></div>
<p><strong>- Reset</strong></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/git-reset.png" width="142"></div>
<p>Reset is one of the options available if you want to undo changes in Git. It can be used to either reset files in your staging index (this is the same as unstage) or resetting commits in your local repository.</p>
<p>Reset can however be a complex tool to use. There are important differences between doing a <em>soft</em>, <em>mixed</em> or <em>hard</em> reset. Particularly a hard reset can be dangerous since it involves resetting your staging environment and working directory to specific commit (a point in time on your Git history tree). This implies that any pending work in your index and working directory will be lost. It therefore important to be careful when using Git reset on your commit history, and to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-reset">read up on the different options</a> before doing so.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Atlassian, â€œGit Reset | Atlassian Git Tutorialâ€ Atlassian, accessed June 16, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-reset"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>It is very important to never use Git reset on a commit that has been published to a shared repository</strong>. When a commit has been pushed to a shared repository you should always assume that your colleagues relies upon this change. If a commit is removed from the projectâ€™s shared history this can create serious and unexpected problems when syncing different branches. Therefore; If you find yourself in a situation where you want to undo a commit that has been pushed to a shared repository you should always use Git <em>revert</em>, not reset. In general revert can be seen as a safer option (see below).</p>
<p><strong>- Revert</strong></p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/git-revert.png" width="136"></div>
<p>Revert is another option for undoing changes in Git, although it is not a traditional undo operation. A Git revert <em>inverts</em> the changes introduced by a commit and <em>appends a new commit</em> with the resulting inverse content, as illustrated by the figure above. This is what makes the revert operation safer than a Git reset. By adding a new commit revert ensures that all the projectâ€™s history is kept in place.</p>
<p>This is also why Git revert should always be the preferred option when reverting a commit that has been shared with others. As mentioned above you should never modify or delete published Git history, something which Git revert nicely avoids.</p>
<p>An other important difference between revert and reset is that revert is able to target an individual commit at an arbitrary point in the history, whereas reset can only work backward from the current commit.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Atlassian, â€œGit Revert | Atlassian Git Tutorialâ€ Atlassian, accessed June 16, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>6</sup></a></p>

</h3>
<p><strong>- What is a merge conflict</strong></p>
<p>Conflicts are usual, and you should not worry if you encounter one. Conflicts regularly arise when the same file was changed in the same line, customarily by two different collaborators. Given a conflict git is unsure of which version is the correct one, and is up to the person carrying the merge to select it. Notice that the solution can be a particular version of a file or a combination of the conflicting versions. The collaborator caring out the merge is responsible for solving the conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>- Solve merge conflicts</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to git UIs as SmartGit or GitKraken solving merge conflicts is easy. When caring a merge using one of this UIs, if a conflict appears the process will be paused and youâ€™ll get notified that the file has a conflict. These UIs have a conflict solver, that will show you both versions of the file allowing you to either select the one to keep or to select line by line what to keep of each one, solving the conflict. In case you need so you may also stop the whole process.</p>
<p>The same can be done using Git command lines, although not covered here, If youâ€™re interested you can find more on this <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>- How to avoid merge conflicts</strong></p>
<p>Some general workflow advice on how to avoid merge conflicts is to always have <em>a separate branch for each issue</em>, only <em>one author per branch</em> and also to create <em>a pull request with a reviewer</em> before the branch is merged to master.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-work-with-pull-requests" class="section level3" number="3.5.6">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.5.6</span> How to work with pull requests<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-work-with-pull-requests"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Working with Git is meant to be a collaborative experience, both dynamic and efficient. Pull requests are a powerful and crucial tool in such aspect.</p>
<p>Pull request can be thought as embed way to let know others about changes you have pushed in a repositoryâ€™s branch. Once a pull request is opened, the chance to engage a discussion about the changes pushed takes place; where collaborators are welcome to share thoughts, concerns and ideas before the changes are merged. In the case you expect input from a particular collaborator you may add a designated reviewer; in many occasions, the reviewer is also the person in charge of the destination branch and will be the person that will ultimately carry the merge.</p>
<p>This is how a pull request looks in Github:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/pullR.png" width="700"></div>
<p>Notice that this contains a title and a message clearly stating the nature of the request/feature. Moreover in this case a reviewer is designated:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="images/pullR1.png" width="430"></div>
<p>The reviewer evaluates the changes approves them and merge the new features to the master branch, in this case. Also remark that a fluid conversation between reviewer and the collaborator arises.</p>

<p><strong>- Issues</strong></p>
<p>Similar to pull request issues is a powerful collaborative tool of Github. An issue works both as a way to assign people to tasks and a forum where people can discuss them.</p>
<p>An issue must have a title and description of the topic to tackle, and usually has labels to help to categorize it, at least one assignee in charge of working on it, and a comment section where the team members can interact. An issue looks something like this:</p>

<p>Even though Git was originally thought to be executed at the command line, there are several GUIs that ease your interaction with Git and get you excited about it. Yet, keep in mind that â€œmost of the GUIs implement only a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity. If you know how to run the command-line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while the opposite is not necessarily true. Also, while your choice of graphical client is a matter of personal taste, all users will have the command-line tools installed and available.â€<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, Pro Git, 2nd ed.Â edition (New York, NY: Apress, 2014). &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line"&gt;sect. 1.4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>7</sup></a></p>

If youâ€™re an existing collaborator, you can create branches, commit and push your work into the main repository. If the repository is hosted in a free Github account, you are even able to merge your branch into the master branch. However, if the repository is paid (PRO) license in GitHub, the owner of the account may set restrictions to collaborators and branches. In the second case, if you are an external user of the repository, you canâ€™t push your work into the original repository but you can fork it (which is making a copy of the repository into your account), modify it as you consider necessary and make a <a href="https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-repositories/pull-requests/">pull request</a>.</p>
<p>In order to contribute into any of the PovcalNet repositories you must be an existing collaborator. Thus, in this section you will learn how to clone a repository.</p>

</li>
<li>Clik on the green button â€œClone or downloadâ€ and copy the whole url.</li>

<p>A commit is a snapshot of your project but, as you work on it, youâ€™re able to decide how the snapshot would look like. You can select what parts or files of your progress will be committed (or snapshotted) and even select what file are not going to be tracked in your progress. All of this is done as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Once your files have been modified (Fig. <a href="collaboration-in-git.html#fig:GKnodes">3.22</a>) and saved, GitKraken identifies them as work in progress (//WIP) and shows you the details in the <strong>Unstaged file</strong> box.</li>
</ol>

<li><p>By clinking in the name of any file in the commit panel (Fig. (fig:GKinterface)), the commit graph will be replace by the <a href="https://support.gitkraken.com/working-with-commits/diff/"><em>GitKraken diffs</em></a> interface which shows what was added or removed from a file. Red is for lines where content was removed whereas green is for new lines added.</p></li>
<li><p>You can select [1] all the files, [2] some of the files, or [3] even some hunks within each file to be <em>stage</em>. Your select will compose the next commit. If you decide you donâ€™t want make a staged file part of your next commit, you can unstage it.</p></li>
<li><p>Record your commit message for the staged files to the repository. In <strong>Summary</strong> you include a brief but meaningful message supporting your commit. This text will appear in the graph and is mandatory. In <strong>Description</strong> you may add extended message to provide more details behind the changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Commit changes</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You may repeat this process as many times you want. When youâ€™re ready, you may push your work to the remote repository into your own branch.</p></li>
