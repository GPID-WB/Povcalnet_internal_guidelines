Population data is saved in the folder ./data. The data is may come from two different sources, WDI or from an internal source in DECDG. Right now, the data is build and shared by Emi Suzuki &lt;esuzuki1@worldbank.org&gt; in an Excel file. The file shared by Emi should be placed without modification in the folder ./data/original. Then, the file is copied again into the folder ./data with the name population_country_yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx where yyyy-mm-dd refers to the official release date of the population data. 5.1.2 update master file Once the new raw population data is in the folder ./data it is necessary to update the population sheet in the master file. This can be done by just type, pcn master, update(population) Finally, you can check the differences between the two versions by using the following code, pcn master, load(Population) rename population pop2 tempfile pop2 save `pop2&#39; // the version to compare with must change depending on the vintage available pcn master, load(Population) version(-1) rename population pop1 merge 1:1 countrycode coveragetype year using `pop2&#39; tab year if _merge == 2 tab countryname if _merge == 2 &amp; year &lt; 2019 gen diffpop = pop1 - pop2 sum diffpop br if abs(diffpop) &gt; `r(mean)&#39;*2*`r(sd)&#39; &amp; diffpop != . Keep in mind that option version(-1) refers to one version before the current one. If it were version(-2), it would be two versions before the current one. Keep in mind that the negative integer in this function refers to the version of the master file and not to the version of the sheet youre loading. Currently, there is no way to track the versions of each sheet in the Master file. 5.2 GDP and Consumption (PCE) GDP and consumption data are used to measure economic growth for the interpolation and extrapolation calculations. 5.2.1 Raw data The raw data of GDP and PCE data comes from WDI through the Stata command wbopendata. For GDP the ticket is NY.GDP.PCAP.KD and for PCE the ticket used is NE.CON.PRVT.PC.KD. For some countries, however, the economic growth data is not available in WDI, so it has to be gathered somewhere else. You can see below for a deeper explanation. 5.2.2 National accounts for special countries 1.Get the latest national accounts file from P:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/04.NationalAccounts/data. 2.Get the relevant data from the latest versions of the World Development Indicators (WDI) and World Economic Outlook (WEO). The WDI series for PCE is NE.CON.PRVT.PC.KD and the WDI series for GDP is NY.GDP.PCAP.KD. The WEO series for GDP is NGDPRPC. If NGDPRPC is not available, use the growth rate provided in NGDPRPPPPCPCH to splice on the series. Below you will find the descriptions of the series. (If the series change in future versions, you can choose related series with advice from R.Andrés Castañeda or Christoph Lakner.) NE.CON.PRVT.PC.KD: Household final consumption expenditure per capita (constant 2010 US$). NY.GDP.PCAP.KD: GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. Data are in constant 2010 U.S. dollars. NGDPRPC: Gross domestic product per capita, constant prices. GDP is expressed in constant national currency per person. Data are derived by dividing constant price GDP by total population.* NGDPRPPPPCPCH: Gross domestic product per capita, constant prices (purchasing power parity; percent change). Data are derived by dividing constant price purchasing-power parity (PPP) GDP by total population. 3.Update the non-missing observations in the PCE and GDP series. Make sure there is no observation where both PCE and GDP are missing. 4.In the Excel file for the national accounts, you will find the source of data and clues on how best to update each observation. Unless otherwise instructed by R.Andrés Castañeda or Christoph Lakner, use the source in the latest version of the national accounts to update the relevant observations. 5.For India, update the latest Excel file with pass-through calculations, which can be found at **P:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/04.NationalAccounts/data/_aux**. Follow instructions in the Excel file and Daniel Mahler to update rural and urban PCE. 5.2.3 update master file 5.3 PPP blah blah 5.4 CPI blah blah "]]
