Two columns of data must be pasted into the text file; one for weight and one for welfare, which may come in three different varieties and are clearly explain the Povcalnet Website. For the case of China 2016, which is the database used as example in this text, data comes in type 5 format,1 which means that the weight variable is the share of the population in a given quantile and the welfare variable is the mean of welfare therein. If the data comes broken down by urban and rural population, it is necessary to create one text file for each distribution. 4.1.2 Naming convention Text files must be saved with the following naming convention, CCCgXX.T0F, where the only literal piece of the naming convention is T0. All the other are as follows: CCC refers to the country code. However, the name of the country has been used in the past. g refers to the geographic area: r for rural, u for urban, and n for national XX stands for the last two digits of the corresponding year of the survey. For example, if the year is 2016, then XX would be 16. F refers to the type formatting of the data. In the case of China 2016 it would be 5. Make sure the text does not have the extension txt. In software used to save the text file includes the extension txt by default, make sure to remove it manually. So, the final name for rural China 2016 would be CHNr16.T05 4.1.3 Upload the data. After logging into the server, the new group data must be uploaded by clicking on choose Files, next to the Data file(s) legend, and choosing the corresponding file from the files explorer. Finally, you have to click on Upload data file(s) at the very right of the page. This process has to be done file by file. Apparently, before the last update of the system, it was possible to upload several files at the same time. Figure 4.1: Upload files 4.2 Master File 4.2.1 Preparing the Master File The following sheets must be modified in the master file (p:/01.PovcalNet/00.Master/Master.xlsm): MasterMean: Add one row with the corresponding information of each group data file uploaded. Make sure columns CountryCode and SurveyTime get updated. Finally, make sure to include the mean of each distribution in the SurveyMean_LCU column. If the mean is not provided, the PovcalNet system does not work. SurveyInfo: Add a row for each country/year data point rather than for urban/rural breakdown. The information in this sheet goes directly into the Info page of each country in the PovcalNet server. CPI: Make sure there is CPI information for the year of the survey. 4.2.2 Upload Master file Once the master file has been updated using the Master file tool, you may proceed to upload the latest version of the master file by selecting the most recent file in the folder p:/01.PovcalNet/00.Master/02.vintage. Then, click on Choose file next to the Metadata file legend. Once the file has chosen, you may click on Upload metadata and then on Reload metadata. Figure 4.2: Upload files 4.3 Making sure everything works Once the new data and the updated metadata are uploaded, you may proceed to click one by one of the buttons shown in Figure 4.3. Make sure, The box Re-make all dataset remain should be checked. Do NOT click on Clean up data files. (Not shown in Figure 4.3) Figure 4.3: Upload files Finally, click on Rebuild listed Economy docs (which needs to be done only once, in case of uploading several times the master file) and then click on Restart PovcalNet. Even though there are only three types of grouped data, they are labeled type 1, type 2, and type5â†© "]
