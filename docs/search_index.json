In general, Git is a version control system to track changes in text file (e.g., do-files, R scripts, csv, etc) and to share those changes with other people. Git is capable of letting you know whether a binary files (e.g., Word, Excel, PDF, DTA, etc) has changed, but it won’t tell how it changed. To get the most out of Git, programers combin it with GitHub, which is a website that to share code with anybody (including people outsite the World Bank), solicit improvements via pull requests, and track issues. 3.1 Initial Set up Make you follow the step below: Open a GitHub account using your World Bank email account. Here or here. Download GitKraken and install it. You don’t need admin permissions to install it, but do NOT download it in the “downloads” folder. Open GitKraken and sign in using your Github account rather than creating a “gitkraken account.” Make sure you’re using Google Chrome instead of IE. Install GIT (Optional). This step is optional because the two steps above suffice for working with Git. However, if you got into Git and want to do really advance stuff, you need to work with GIT directly. Make sure R and RStudio are installed and updated in your computer. Even though we have not decided whether or not to work with R from now on, Rstudio is great IDE that allows us to do a lot of things including GIT management 3.2 Getting to know Git Git is a Distributed Version Control System. This means that Git is a sysmte to fully clones the project and in its history into any client’s repository or local computer. Every time you save the state of your project (i.e., commit), Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots of the whole project. This ability of taking snapshopts of the projects is what makes Git to any other version control system. Other systems, like Microsoft Word or any other MS softaware, changes are tracked at the file level rather than at the project level. People is able to know how files have changes individually, but they don’t know how those files change with respect to the changes applied to other files of the same project. 3.3 Getting to know GitKraken Even though Git was originally thought to be executed at the command line, there are several GUIs that ease your interaction with Git and get you excited about it. Yet, keep in mind that “most of the GUIs implement only a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity. If you know how to run the command-line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while the opposite is not necessarily true. Also, while your choice of graphical client is a matter of personal taste, all users will have the command-line tools installed and available.”1 Among the GUIs avialable, we thinkg GitKraken is the best one to get you started. However, if you’re interested on learning Git at the command line, we recommend the book Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, which is available online for free. The best place to learn everything about GitKraken is the GitKraken Support webpage. However, bellow you will finde the most basic things that you need to know about it and, when considered necessary, you will find either reference links for more detailed inforamtion or embeded videos. For instance, the video bellow shows the basics of GitKraken. Figure 3.1: Introduction to GitKraken GItKraken Interface Figure 3.2: GitKraken Interface Figure 3.2 presents the GItKraken interface, which has four main components. The Toolbar shows the most common actions in repositories. In our case, we will focus on pull, push, and branch. The Left reference panel shows properties of your repository. In this panel you can see waht branches are steored in your local computer and which in the cloud (i.e., remote repository). You may use it also to know whether you’re ahead or behind any specific branch. The Commit panel at your right is where files and changes from your working directory are being watched (i.e., tracked). In this panel you may can see whether a particular file has been modified (orange), deleted (red), created (green) or renamed (blue) with respect to the previous commit. Also, you can see the state of your files with in your current commit. That is, you may know whether each file is staged or unstaged. Figure 3.3: color guide for file symbols The commit graph is the core of your repository’s development and a representation of the Directed Acyclic Graph. As explained in the GitKraken documentation, “[e]ach row of the graph represents one commit, and the top is always for the latest changes. An interactive //WIP (Work-In-Progress) node will show if the working directory has changed since the last commit. Branches and tag labels on the left side of the graph are pointers to specific commits, and each vertical column represents a branch currently available on the repository. Columns can intersect through merge commits as shown in the graph legend. As also shown, multiple branches can be at the same place of a single commit and can be both local and remote.” Figure 3.4: Nodes meaning 3.4 Basics of Git 3.4.1 Working with repositories Create a repository In Git, a repository refers to a folder with all the files and sub-folders of a project. In other words, it refers to the folder of a project. It is possible to create a git repository in an existing project folder, but it is recommended to intialize a Git repository before you start working on your project. Open GitKraken and click on the folder icon at the upper-left side of the screen and then click Init. Alternatively, you coul go to file -&gt; Init repo, or use the shortcut Ctrl + I. Given that we are going to be working with GitHub, click on the icon GitHub.com. Select your account in case you have more than one GitHub account. Provide a name for your repository. The name cannot have spaces. If you want, add a description of the project. Select Public or Private repository. Keep in mind that if you have a free GitHub account: You can have unlimited public repositories with unlimited collaborators. You can have unlimited private repositories with no more than three collaborators. This is very inconvinient for large teams like PovcalNet. Check the box Clone after init Select the folder in your computer where you want to clone the repository. Make you do NOT create a folder for the repositoy because Git will created for you using the name provided in step 2.2. You only need provide the root folder. Do not do anything on the field Full Path. It is just for your information. Do not select anything on .gitignore yet. We wil cover that below. If you are creating a package or a document that must be cited if used, select MIT license leave unchecked the box initialize with LFS Your screen should look something like this: Figure 3.5: Initialize repo Once you have create your repository, make sure to open it and initialize it. Clonning a repository If you want to contribute in an existing repository, you can do it as an existing collaborator or as an external user. If you’re an existing collaborator, you can create branches, commit and push your work into the main repository. If the repository is hosted in a free Github account, you are even able to merge your branch into the master branch. However, if the repository is paid (PRO) license in GitHub, the owner of the account may set restrictions to collaborators and branches. In the second case, if your are an external user of the repository, you can’t push your work into the original respotory but your can fork it (which is making a copy of the repository into your account), modify it as you consider necessary and make a pull request. In order to contribute into any of the PovcalNet repositories you must be an existing collaborator. Thus, in this section you will learn how to clone a repository. Go the to the repository you want clone in GitHub. Clik on the green button “Clone or download” and copy the whole url. Figure 3.6: GitHub link to clone repo Go to GitKraken and click on the folder icon at the upper-left side of the screen and then click clone. Alternatively, you coul go to file -&gt; Clone repo, or use the shortcut Ctrl + N. Select the Github.com icon Select the folder where the repository is going to be cloned Select the repository from the menu. Figure 3.7: Clone repo in GitKraken 3.4.2 Working with commits A commit is a snapshot of your project but, as you work on it, you’re able to decide how the snapshot would look like. You can select what parts or files of your progress will be commited (or snapshoted) and even select what file are not going to be tracked in your progress. All of this is done as follows: Once your files have been modified (Fig. 3.4) and saved, GitKraken identifies them as work in progress (//WIP) and shows you the details in the Unstaged file box. Figure 3.8: GitKraken Work In Progress By clinking in the name of any file in the commit panel (Fig. (fig:GKinterface)), the commit graph will be replace by the GitKraken diffs interface which shows what was added or removed from a file. Red is for lines where content was removed whereas green is for new lines added. You can select [1] all the files, [2] some of the files, or [3] even some hunks within each file to be stage. Your select will compose the next commit. If you decide you don’t want make a staged file part of your next commit, you can unstage it. Record your commit message for the staged files to the repository. In Summary you include a brief but meaningful message supporting your commit. This text will appear in the graph and is mandatory. In Description you may add extended message to provide more details behind the changes. Click Commit changes You may repeat this process as many times you want. When you’re ready, you may push your work to the remote repository into your own branch. 3.4.3 Branching and Merging Branching and merging are the core of collaborating with multiple people. Branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The master branch is the “default” branch when you create a repository. Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch upon completion. “Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future’s history before merging it into the main branch.”2 Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, Pro Git, 2nd ed. edition (New York, NY: Apress, 2014). sect. 1.4↩ Atlassian, “Git Branch | Atlassian Git Tutorial” Atlassian, accessed June 3, 2019, link.↩ "]
