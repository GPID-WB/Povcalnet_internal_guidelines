# Prepare data for PovcalNet update {#prepare}

In this chapter we briefly describe what needs to be done with each
auxiliary dataset used to update PovcalNet. Each of the next sections
describes one dataset and, in general, they are divided in **Raw Data**
and **Update Master File** subsection.

Most of the updating of the master file is carried by the
`pcn master, udpate(sheet)` command in Stata, where `sheet` refers to
name of the sheet in the master file. If you need to make any
modification, please make sure to create a new branch from the most
recent of the master branch in the
[PovcalNet-Team/pcn](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn) Github
repository.

## Population

### Raw data

Everything related population data should be placed in the folder
`p:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/03.Population`, hereafter (`./`).

Population data is saved in the folder `./data`. The data may come from
two different sources, WDI or from an internal source in DECDG. Right
now, the data is built and shared by
`Emi Suzuki <esuzuki1@worldbank.org>` in an Excel file.

The file shared by Emi should be placed without modification in the
folder `./data/original`. Then, the file is copied again into the folder
`./data` with the name `population_country_yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx` where
`yyyy-mm-dd` refers to the official release date of the population data.
As of today, `r format(Sys.time(), "%B %d, %Y")`, the files available in
the system are,

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("p:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/03.Population/data", 
             recurse = FALSE)
```

### update master file

Once the new raw population data is in the folder `./data` it is
necessary to update the `population` sheet in the master file. This can
be done by just typing,

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
pcn master, update(population)
```

Finally, you can check the differences between the two versions by using
the following code,

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
pcn master, load(Population) 
rename population pop2

tempfile pop2
save `pop2'

// 'the version to compare with must change depending on the vintage available
pcn master, load(Population) version(-1) 
rename population pop1
merge 1:1 countrycode coveragetype year using `pop2', gen(checkpop)  // '

tab year if (checkpop == 2)
tab countryname if (checkpop == 2 & year < 2019)
gen diffpop = pop1 - pop2
sum diffpop
br if abs(diffpop) > `r(mean)'*2*`r(sd)' & diffpop != .

```

Keep in mind that option `version(-1)` refers to one version before the
current one. If it were `version(-2)`, it would be two versions before
the current one. Keep in mind that the negative integer in this function
refers to the version of the master file and not to the version of the
sheet you're loading. Currently, there is no way to track the versions
of each sheet in the Master file.

## GDP and Consumption (PCE)

GDP and consumption data are used to measure economic growth for the
interpolation and extrapolation calculations. PCE refers to "per capita
expenditure", more conventionally known as household final consumption
expenditure (HFCE).

### Raw data

The raw data of GDP and PCE data comes from WDI through the Stata
command `wbopendata`. For GDP the indicator is `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD` (GDP per
capita--constant 2010 US\$) and for PCE the indicator used is
`NE.CON.PRVT.PC.KD` (Households Final Consumption Expenditure per
capita--constant 2010 US\$). For some countries, however, the economic
growth data is not available in WDI, in which case we use data from WEO,
the Maddison project, and country specific sources, in that order. You
can see [below](#scnac) a deeper explanation and process on how to
update the auxiliary files for these special cases.

#### Preparing for updating of master file {#scnac .unnumbered}

In order to prepare the data before the master file can be updated, do
the following,

1.  Get the data from the latest version of the [World Economic
    Outlook](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/world-economic-outlook-databases#sort=%40imfdate%20descending)
    (WEO). Save it in the folder
    `P:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/04.NationalAccounts/data` with the name
    `WEO_YYYY-mm-dd.xls`, where `YYYY` refers to year, `mm`to month, and
    `dd`to day (identifying the vintage of the file).
2.  Make sure that the Maddison data used in the pcn_master_update.ado
    is the most recent vintage available of the Maddison Database:
    <https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/data>. If it
    is not, change the line in the pcn_master_update.ado accordingly.
3.  Check with Andr√©s, Christoph, or Daniel on whether any things need
    to be changed for the countries that use country specific sources.
    These *Special Cases* can be found in the folder
    `P:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/04.NationalAccounts/data`. This folder
    contains all the different versions previously used in **PovcalNet**
    with national accounts info on special cases. Each file is called
    `NAS special_YYYY-mm-dd.xlsx`. When you update the information of
    these files make sure you, open the most recent version, save with
    the current date, edit it as needed. In the country-specific sheets,
    you will find the source of data and clues on how best to update
    each observation. IMPORTANT: You should check whether the
    country-year is still a special case; e.g. the standard WDI, WEO and
    Maddison sources may have been extended to cover additional years.
    Similarly, there could be new special cases (i.e. WDI/WEO/Maddison
    observations were available in a previous vintage, but no longer
    are).Make sure you have the exact variables (countryname coverage
    countrycode year GDP PCE sourceGDP sourcePCE) as in the previous
    Excel file for the special cases national accounts.The variable
    names are case-sensitive.

#### Description of WEO series {.unnumbered}

-   ***NE.CON.PRVT.PC.KD***: Household final consumption expenditure per
    capita (constant 2010 US\$).

-   ***NY.GDP.PCAP.KD***: GDP per capita is gross domestic product
    divided by midyear population. Data are in constant 2010 U.S.
    dollars.

-   ***NGDPRPC***: Gross domestic product per capita, constant prices.
    GDP is expressed in constant national currency per person. Data are
    derived by dividing constant price GDP by total population.

-   ***NGDPRPPPPCPCH***: Gross domestic product per capita, constant
    prices (purchasing power parity; percent change). Data are derived
    by dividing constant price purchasing-power parity (PPP) GDP by
    total population.

### Update master file

Once the *special cases* file has been updated you must update the
master file by using the following command lines,

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
pcn master, update(gdp)
pcn master, update(pce)
```

The `pcn` command integrates all the WDI, WEO, Maddison, and Special
Cases files in the correct format of the master file. You can run these
lines even if only one of the sources gets updated. If you want to
understand how these two sheets get updated, you can see the procedure
in the file
[*pcn_master_update.ado*](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn/blob/master/pcn_master_update.ado)*.*
In particular, you can see [these
lines](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn/blob/790a1b1fc721199dfe1cdbbc103d399174785cc9/pcn_master_update.ado#L170-L354)
for GDP and [these
lines](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn/blob/790a1b1fc721199dfe1cdbbc103d399174785cc9/pcn_master_update.ado#L360-L508)
for PCE.

## CPI and PPP

Even though the CPI and PPP come from different sources, in the
PovcalNet update process we use the most recent version provided by
`datalibweb` (DLW). DLW provides a curated, clean, and organized file
with all the CPIs and PPPs values for all the countries and years. If
you want to load the most recent version directly from DLW, you use the
following lines of code,

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
local cpipath "c:\ado\personal\Datalibweb\data\GMD\SUPPORT\SUPPORT_2005_CPI"
local cpidirs: dir "`cpipath'" dirs "*CPI_*_M"

local cpivins "0"
foreach cpidir of local cpidirs {
	if regexm("`cpidir'", "cpi_v([0-9]+)_m") local cpivin = regexs(1)
	local cpivins "`cpivins', `cpivin'"
}
local cpivin = max(`cpivins')


cap datalibweb, country(Support) year(2005) type(GMDRAW) /*
*/	surveyid(Support_2005_CPI_v0`cpivin'_M) /* 
*/	filename(Final_CPI_PPP_to_be_used.dta)	

```

### Word of Caution {#cpicaution}

Be aware that as of today (2020-11-17) the `datalibweb` system is being
updating and it is likely that the convention used to vintage control
the CPI data will change in the following month. That is, Dec 2020. If
that is the case, the code above would be obsolete and it will need to
be updated in the
[pcn_update_cpi.ado](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn/blob/master/pcn_update_cpi.ado)
file and in the
[pcn_master_update.ado](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn/blob/master/pcn_master_update.ado).

### Different CPI datasets

The `pcn` command updates and loads *two* databases of the CPI and PPP,
and thus, you need to update both datasets when the CPI or PPP data is
updated in DLW.

#### Special CPI cases {.unnumbered}

The primary source of CPI data for PovcalNet updates is the IMF's
International Financial Statistics (IFS) database
[@laknerConsumerPriceIndices2018a]. When CPI series from surveys are
deemed more appropriate, they are used instead of IFS CPI series.
Currently, six countries are in this category of 'special CPI cases',
including Bangladesh, Ghana, Lao, Malawi, Tajikistan, and Zimbabwe.

The datafiles and dofiles for the special CPI cases are stored in this
path, `p:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/09.CPI/Special CPI Cases/`.

You should follow the steps below to update the special CPI cases:

1.  Get CPI input file labeled as "Imputed_CPI_input.xlsx" from the
    P-drive. This file contains raw CPI series imputed from survey to
    survey.

2.  Update the CPI input file if necessary. This file is updated when
    there is a new survey from which a new CPI can be imputed. (A
    country is not always a special case: A new survey may use the IFS
    CPI; the imputed CPIs are only used in exceptional cases.) The new
    CPIs are provided by poverty economists (PE's). [Daniel Gerszon
    Mahler](mailto:dmahler@worldbank.org) currently liaises with PE's to
    get the correct CPI and survey year. You may contact him for
    guidance and ideas for the whole exercise.

3.  Get yearly annual CPI series from Datalibweb. The yearly annual
    series are collated and organized by [Minh Cong
    Nguyen](mailto:mnguyen3@worldbank.org) from monthly (or, in a few
    cases, quarterly) IFS data and annual World Economic Outlook (WEO)
    data. Use the code below to obtain the required data.

```{stata, eval = FALSE}

dlw, country(support) year(2005) type(gmdraw) surveyid(Support_2005_CPI_v05_M) filename(Yearly_CPI_Final.dta)

```

[Note that this code is for the current version of Datalibweb (i.e.,
Support_2005_CPI_v05). Check with [Minh Cong
Nguyen](mailto:mnguyen3@worldbank.org) for the latest version and line
of code to use.]

4.  Generate a final data set with label
    "ImputedCPIs_output_yyyymmdd.dta". This file contains the final CPI
    series with the ICP reference year as base year, which is
    currently 2011. See the latest file for the required format.

5.  As robustness checks, construct the final CPI series afresh as in
    sheet(Calculations) in "Compare Imputed CPIs yyyymmdd.xlsx" and
    compare the Excel results with the Stata output. You may compare the
    results using the dofile labelled
    "combine_countries_compare_results.do".

6.  Send the Stata output to [Minh Cong
    Nguyen](mailto:mnguyen3@worldbank.org). He will integrate the file
    into his price framework.

7.  Save all datafiles and dofiles in a sub-folder in the P-drive [e.g.,
    P:\\CPI\\Special CPI Cases\\PovcalNet Update Mar 2021].

#### Internal data {.unnumbered}

This dataset is used only by the *PovcalNet* team and can be loaded in
Stata by using the `pcn load cpi, clear` directive and updated by using
the directive `pcn update cpi`. This dataset is intended to be used for
general purposes that require deflation such as reports, papers, or even
internal tests. However, it can't be used to update the *CPI* sheet in
the master file. Though the data is the same, the format and labels are
very different between the two. If you need to update the format of this
dataset, you need to modify the file
[pcn_update_cpi.ado](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn/blob/master/pcn_update_cpi.ado)

#### *CPI* sheet in the Master file {.unnumbered}

This dataset can be loaded though the directive,
`pcn master, load(cpi)`. By default the data will be loaded in Stata in
wide form, which is the original format in the master file. You can load
it in Stata basically for testing and checking purposes but it is highly
discouraged to use this data for any data work. It comes in a very
unfriendly format that is only useful for the PovcalNet system. `pcn`,
however, provides the option `pcn master, load(cpi) shape(long)` that
attempts to reshape the data in long format for ease of use, but it is
still not as nice and friendly as the data loaded from `pcn load cpi`.

In order to updated the *CPI* sheet in the master file, you must use the
directives `pcn master, update(cpi)` and `pcn master, update(ppp)`. Even
though the CPI and PPP come from the same file, they are split in two
different sheets in the master file. Keep in mind that if the CPI
vintage control in DLW changes as mention [above](#cpicaution), you will
need to update the corresponding lines in
[pcn_master_update.ado](https://github.com/PovcalNet-Team/pcn/blob/790a1b1fc721199dfe1cdbbc103d399174785cc9/pcn_master_update.ado#L71-L164).
