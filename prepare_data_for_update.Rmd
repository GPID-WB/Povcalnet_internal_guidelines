# (PART) Povcalnet Update {-}

# Prepare data for PovcalNet update {#prepare}

In this section we briefly describe what needs to be done with each auxiliary file to update PovcalNet

## Population

### Raw data
Everything related population data should be placed in the folder `p:/01.PovcalNet/03.QA/03.Population`, hereafter (`./`).

Population data is saved in the folder `./data`. The data is may come from two different sources, WDI or from an internal source in DECDG. Right now, the data is build and shared by `Emi Suzuki <esuzuki1@worldbank.org>` in an Excel file. 

The file shared by Emi should be placed without modification in the folder `./data/original`. Then, the file is copied again into the folder `./data` with the name `population_country_yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx` where `yyyy-mm-dd` refers to the official release date of the population data. 


### update master file

Once the new raw population data is in the folder `./data` it is necessary to update the `population` sheet in the master file. This can be done by just type, 

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
pcn master, update(population)
```

Finally, you can check the differences between the two versions by using the following code, 

```{stata, eval = FALSE}
pcn master, load(Population) 
rename population pop2

tempfile pop2
save `pop2'

// the version to compare with must change depending on the vintage available
pcn master, load(Population) version(20200529073145) 
rename population pop1

merge 1:1 countrycode coveragetype year using `pop2'

tab year if _merge == 2

tab countryname if _merge == 2 & year < 2019

gen diffpop = pop1 - pop2
sum diffpop
br if abs(diffpop) > `r(mean)'*2*`r(sd)' & diffpop != .

```
