# (PART) PovcalNet Update {.unnumbered}

# Introduction to PovcalNet Update {#intro-povcal}

Updating the PovcalNet system requires putting together many different pieces
that interact with each other. This part of the book is divided from the perspective
of independent procedures rather than particular outputs. For instance, the
**Master file** is a single Excel file with several spreadsheets that is
updated in several processes. Instead of creating a chapter for
updating the whole Master file (though it exists as a summary), we think it is
better to explain separately each of the processes that add up to update the
whole Master file.

## Overview

**TO-DO**: Include a chart with the workflow.
