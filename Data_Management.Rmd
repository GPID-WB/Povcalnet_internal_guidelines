# Upload Group Data to the Data Management System {#DMGroupData}

The Data Management system is managed directly within your Internet Browser.
Since it is available to anyone in the World Bank, you need to request to the
TTLs of the PovcalNet team the correct url. For now, it is worth mentioning that
there are *four* different servers in the PovcalNet system.

### Development (internal) server {.unnumbered}

The Development (or Internal) server is mainly for quality assurance (QA) work.
The whole PovcalNet update is done in this server. Everything that is explained
in this chapter is supposed to be done in this server. Once it is done, ITS will
make a perfect copy into production.

### Production {.unnumbered}

The production server is the final step in the deployment process. In reality,
the production server is two servers that run in the back-en of the PovcalNet
website, balancing out the load of users requests at all time. This server is
not managed by any member of the PovcalNet team, but only by ITS. When the
update is complete in the Development server, ITS makes a perfect copy from
development to production, deploying thus a new version of the whole PovcalNet
system.

### Testing server {.unnumbered}

This server is mainly used for experimentation. The kind of work done in this
server may highly affect the overall structure of the PovcalNet system, and
therefore it cannot be done in either development of production. For instance,
in 2020 the PovcalNet team and the Poverty GP wanted to assess the possibility
of removing the consumption data of Mexico, leaving only the income data into de
system. To avoid problems on development or production, this assessment was done
in the testing server, where the data could be removed safely and a special
version of the master file could be uploaded.

### Restricted (AR) server {.unnumbered}

This server is used when restricted data are intended to be part of the
PovcalNet system. In theory, anyone in the WB may access the data in the
testing, development, or production servers. The restricted server just adds an
extra layer of authentication in which only selected people can access the data.
It is seldom used.

## Group Data

### Preparing the data

Once the Group Data is received from the regional focal point of the Poverty GP,
It has to be copied and pasted into a text file. Two columns of data must be
pasted into the text file; one for weight and one for welfare, which may come in
three different varieties and are clearly explain the [Povcalnet
Website](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/povcalculator.aspx). For the
case of China 2016, which is the database used as example in this text, data
comes in type 5 format,[^data_management-1] which means that the weight variable
is the share of the population in a given quantile and the welfare variable is
the mean of welfare therein. If the data comes broken down by urban and rural
population, it is necessary to create one text file for each distribution.

[^data_management-1]: Even though there are only three types of grouped data,
    they are labeled type 1, type 2, and type5

### Naming convention

Text files must be saved with the following naming convention,

> `CCCgXX.T0F`

where the only literal piece of the naming convention is `T0`. All the other are
as follows:

-   `CCC` refers to the country code. However, the name of the country has been
    used in the past.
-   `g` refers to the geographic area: `r` for rural, `u` for urban, and `n` for
    national
-   `XX` stands for the last two digits of the corresponding year of the survey.
    For example, if the year is 2016, then `XX` would be 16.
-   `F` refers to the type formatting of the data. In the case of China 2016 it
    would be 5.

Make sure the text does not have the extension `txt`. In software used to save
the text file includes the extension `txt` by default, make sure to remove it
manually.

So, the final name for rural China 2016 would be `CHNr16.T05`

### Upload the data.

After logging into the server, the new group data must be uploaded by clicking
on `choose Files`, next to the *Data file(s)* legend, and choosing the
corresponding file from the files explorer. Finally, you have to click on
`Upload data file(s)` at the very right of the page. This process has to be done
file by file. Apparently, before the last update of the system, it was possible
to upload several files at the same time.

```{r DM-upload-files, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Upload files", fig.show = "hold", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DM_upload_files.png")
```

## Making sure everything works

Once the new data and the updated metadata are uploaded, you may proceed to
click one by one of the buttons shown in Figure \@ref(fig:DM-check). Make sure,

1.  The box `Re-make all dataset` remain should be checked.
2.  Do **NOT** click on `Clean up data files.` (Not shown in Figure
    \@ref(fig:DM-check))

```{r DM-check, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Upload files", fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DM_check_files.png")
```

Finally, click on `Rebuild listed Economy docs` (which needs to be done only
once, in case of uploading several times the master file) and then click on
`Restart PovcalNet`.
